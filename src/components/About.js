          We have very good Missions to solve daily life problems!! use of inote
          can be done differently some people can use to note something secure
          or private note and some people to use to note to-do list or some of
          them can use to note food recipe üòã. So the use of √ç√ëotes can be done
          anyway. Use of √ç√ëotes depends on own totally on you just make sure or
          how you can make use of it.
